Poke Competions
time stuff so that you have to poke quickly in the dojo
SUPER AMAZING STUFF
    Super market with food
    pokelets
    in dojo, when you test, you have to spar and beat your opponent
        take turns,
        you attack first
        you can poke head, stomach, or leg
        comp will generate ranodom number from 1 to 3
        if 1 then comp will high block
        if 2 then comp will middle block
        if 3 then comp will low block
        if comp blocks corectly, attack fails, else opponent loses one hp
        then you try to block correctly
        you always get 5 hp
        when testing for emperor, comp has 15 hp
        test for dayimo camp has 14 hp
        test fo sensei comp has 13 hp
        etc.
        if you fail, test fee is still taken, but you need to attend five more classes
        BTW I added something so that every time you poke, there is a delay, but with higher ranks in the dojo come shorter delays!
        FINALLY A USE FOR THE DOJO!
    In shop
        shop name is gotta buy it all!
        cuz poke is like poké
        and yeah
        so then just like how there are upgrades in the shop, there will be memberships that you buy just like any other upgrade
        there is bronze membership for 100,000 points
        you get 1% off all purchases in the shop
        silver membership for 1,000,000 points
        you get 2% off all purchases in the shop
        gold membership for 100,000,000 points
        you get 3% off all purchases in the shop
        and finally platinum membership for 1,000,000,000 points
        you get 5% off all purchases in the shop
        Also, every time you enter the shop, there is a 10% chance thatthe shop keeper will ask you which 
        pokémon is your favorite
        if you reply with some pokémon, I don't know which yet, maybe venusaur, then the shop keeper will say
        Thats my favorite too! let's be friends!
        and you get an additionla 2% to whatever you had with the membership
    Oh yeah, and I added rewards for like 10 pokes 100 pokes 1000 pokes and that stuff, so we should change it from like scratching and slicing and stuff
    you always poke
    yeah, that's it pretty much.
